# Barduino
The JavaScript piano player uses WebAudio API and Arduino Uno.

## Run piano with Arduino Uno:
1. Install dependencies from `package.json`:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Connect your Arduino Uno board to USB port (or wherever suits you) using sketch below:
(comming soon)
3. Run:

  ```
  node index
  ```

4. Open browser and type `http://localhost:3000'.

You're ready to play. After board is detected, you should hear and see "Old MacDonald had a farm" song playing in inifinite loop. To break it just press one of piano keys and play your own song!

## Run piano without Arduino Uno.
Well, it goes pretty much the same way. The only difference is, that you won't see the leds blinking as you press keyboard keys.
